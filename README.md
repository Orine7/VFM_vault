# VFM_vault

# DISCLAIMER
I'm not the leading dev neither am a major developer on this mod, I'm simply trying to organize my contributions to this mod.
This is a repo made to store my contributions to the Victorian Flavour mod for Vicky 3.


If you want to contribute to the repo, you can contact me on the discord server, I'll add you into this repo and you can create a branch for your contribution.

For starters I'll only be hoarding historical data, until the game releases.
I strongly recommend you to use the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) note taking app as I use it to store my notes and make changes.
in the "\_Storage" Folders you'll find all files regarding pics and templates used to make this vault.

For more information about my contribution, you can DM me in discord.
